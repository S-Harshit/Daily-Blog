## ðŸ“˜ Daily LeetCode Log

A simple daily log of LeetCode problems I solve or projects I build to improve problem-solving skills and stay consistent.  
The goal is to do **1 problem every day no matter what**, along with some project work.

- **Problem:** [Power of Two](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-consecutive-ones/)
- **Difficulty:** Easy  
- **Category:** Recursion  
- **My Approach:**  
- I stored the number into a float.
- Then in a while loop kept on dividing that number by 2,
- if the number becomes equal to 2 then it is power of 2.
- If the number becomes less than 2 then it is not power of 2.
- If the number is `0`, I reset the consecutive counter.  
- but the question is of recursion. The recursion way I was not able to figure out by myself although as an exuse I didn't spend much time thinking .

- **Time Taken:** 10 min  

- **Solution Code:**

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isPowerOfTwo(int n) {
        double num = n; 
        if(n==1) {
            return true;
        }
        while(num>1) {
             if(num == 2) {
                return true;
             }
            num = num/2;
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```

- **Optimized Code:**

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isPowerOfTwo(int n) {
         if (n == 1) {
            return true;
        }
        if (n <= 0 || n % 2 != 0) {
            return false;
        }
        return isPowerOfTwo(n / 2);
    
    }
}
