## ðŸ“˜ Daily LeetCode Log

A simple daily log of LeetCode problems I solve or projects I build to improve problem-solving skills and stay consistent.  
The goal is to do **1 problem every day no matter what**, along with some project work.

- **Problem:** [Reverse String](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string/description/)
- **Difficulty:** Easy  
- **Category:** Arrays  
- **My Approach:**  
  - Read the first hint, then used two pointersâ€”one at the start position and one at the end.  
  - Started swapping the elements until the first pointer became greater than or equal to the second.  
- **Time Taken:** 2 min

- **Problem:** Recreate the `Promise` Constructor Function  
- **Difficulty:** Easy  
- **Category:** Frontend  
- **My Approach:**  
  - Created a function with internal properties: `state`, `result`, and two methodsâ€”`resolve` and `reject`.  
  - Both methods are passed to the callback as the first and second arguments.  
  - If the callback calls `resolve`, it sets the state to "fulfilled" and updates the result with the value passed to `resolve`.  
  - If `reject` is called instead, the state changes to "rejected" and the result gets set with the rejection value.  
  - Still need to add `.then`, `.catch`, and `.finally` so the appropriate callbacks run when the promise is resolved or rejected.  

  It really messes with your head at first trying to figure out how to implement this, but after going over it a few times, it started to make more sense.  
  Is it necessary to know how to implement the Promise constructor? Not at all Acutally might even be pointless.  
  But understanding how it's built definitely sharpens problem-solving skills or so I hope.
