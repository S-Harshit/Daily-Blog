## ðŸ“˜ Daily LeetCode Log

A simple daily log of LeetCode problems I solve or projects I build to improve problem-solving skills and stay consistent.  
The goal is to do **1 problem every day no matter what**, along with some project work.

*Side note: This is day 4, and the motivation is definitely starting to dip â€” hoping discipline (or whatever else kicks in) is enough to carry this through.*

- **Problem:** [Move Zeroes](https://leetcode.com/problems/move-zeroes/)
- **Difficulty:** Easy  
- **Category:** Arrays  
- **My Approach:**  
  - Since the last problem I did was around sliding windows, I tried to carry over the same thinking here.
  - I used two pointers: `ptr1` to scan through the array, and `ptr0` to keep track of where the next non-zero element should be placed.
  - The idea was to move all non-zero elements toward the front by swapping them with zeros at the earliest available spot.
  - If `ptr0` is pointing at a zero and `ptr1` finds a non-zero, I perform a swap and advance `ptr0`.
  - While this approach is functional and meets the in-place constraint, it turned out to be more complex than needed and a bit less efficient.
  - Took around 30 minutes to get it working correctly, especially due to the pointer management.

- **Time Taken:** 1 hr  

- **Solution Code:**

```java
class Solution {

    public void moveZeroes(int[] nums) {
        
        int ptr1 = 1;
        int ptr0 = 0;
        for (int i = ptr1; ptr1 < nums.length; ptr1++) {
            if (nums[ptr0] != 0) {
                ptr0++;
            }
            if (nums[ptr1] == 0) {
                continue;
            } else if (nums[ptr0] == 0) {
                nums[ptr0] = nums[ptr1];
                nums[ptr1] = 0;
                ptr0++;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

- **Optimized Code:**

```java
class Solution {

    public void moveZeroes(int[] nums) {
        int insertPosition = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[i] != 0) {
                nums[insertPosition++] = nums[i];
            }
        }

        while (insertPosition < nums.length) {
            nums[insertPosition++] = 0;
        }
    }
}
```
