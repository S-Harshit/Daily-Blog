## ðŸ“˜ Daily LeetCode Log

A simple daily log of LeetCode problems I solve or projects I build to improve problem-solving skills and stay consistent.  
The goal is to do **1 problem every day no matter what**, along with some project work.

- **Problem:** [Max Consecutive Ones](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-consecutive-ones/)
- **Difficulty:** Easy  
- **Category:** Arrays  
- **My Approach:**  
  - I simply looped through all the numbers.  
- If the number is `1`, I increment the consecutive counter.  
- If the consecutive count exceeds `max_consecutive`, I update `max_consecutive`.  
- If the number is `0`, I reset the consecutive counter.  
- One thing Iâ€™ve noticed about my code is that it feels like something a beginner would write. The way i think in my head is very straightforward â€” "if this condition is true, then do this; if another condition is met, then do that." There isnâ€™t much complexity or abstraction, especially compared to other peopleâ€™s code, which often seems more elegant or optimized.

- **Time Taken:** 10 min  

- **Solution Code:**

```java
class Solution {
    public int findMaxConsecutiveOnes(int[] nums) {
        int max_consecutive = 0;
        int consecutive  = 0;


        for(int i=0; i<nums.length; i++ ) {
           if(nums[i] == 1) {
            consecutive++;
           }
           if(max_consecutive < consecutive) {
            max_consecutive = consecutive;
           } 
           if(nums[i] == 0) {
            consecutive = 0;
           }
        }
        
        return max_consecutive;
    }
}
```

- **Optimized Code:**

```java
class Solution {
    public int findMaxConsecutiveOnes(int[] nums) {
        int max_consecutive = 0;
        int consecutive = 0;

        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num == 1) {
                consecutive++;
                max_consecutive = Math.max(max_consecutive, consecutive);
            } else {
                consecutive = 0;
            }
        }

        return max_consecutive;
    }
}

```
