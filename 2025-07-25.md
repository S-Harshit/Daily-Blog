## ðŸ“˜ Daily LeetCode Log

A simple daily log of LeetCode problems I solve or projects I build to improve problem-solving skills and stay consistent.  
The goal is to do **1 problem every day no matter what**, along with some project work.

- **Problem:** [Max Consecutive Ones](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-consecutive-ones/)
- **Difficulty:** Easy  
- **Category:** Arrays  
- **My Approach:**  
    - I simply looped through all the numbers.  
- If the number is `1`, I increment the consecutive counter.  
- If the consecutive count exceeds `max_consecutive`, I update `max_consecutive`.  
- If the number is `0`, I reset the consecutive counter.  
- One thing Iâ€™ve noticed about my code is that it feels like something a beginner would write. The way i think in my head is very straightforward â€” "if this condition is true, then do this; if another condition is met, then do that." There isnâ€™t much complexity or abstraction, especially compared to other peopleâ€™s code, which often seems more elegant or optimized.

- **Time Taken:** 10 min  

- **Solution Code:**

```java
class Solution {
    public int findMaxConsecutiveOnes(int[] nums) {
        int max_consecutive = 0;
        int consecutive  = 0;


        for(int i=0; i<nums.length; i++ ) {
           if(nums[i] == 1) {
            consecutive++;
           }
           if(max_consecutive < consecutive) {
            max_consecutive = consecutive;
           } 
           if(nums[i] == 0) {
            consecutive = 0;
           }
        }
        
        return max_consecutive;
    }
}
```

- **Optimized Code:**

```java
class Solution {
    public int findMaxConsecutiveOnes(int[] nums) {
        int max_consecutive = 0;
        int consecutive = 0;

        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num == 1) {
                consecutive++;
                max_consecutive = Math.max(max_consecutive, consecutive);
            } else {
                consecutive = 0;
            }
        }

        return max_consecutive;
    }
}

```

- **Problem:** [Single Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number/)
- **Difficulty:** Easy  
- **Category:** Arrays  
- **My Approach:**  
- I simply looped through all the numbers.  
- Added each number to a map along with the count of its occurrences.  
- Then looped through the map and returned the number with a value of 1.  
- This approach isn't optimal â€” it uses extra space and requires two passes (2n time).  
- Instead, there's a cleaner way: just keep XOR'ing each number with the `result`.  
- Duplicate numbers cancel each other out due to the XOR property.  
- Only the unique number â€” the one that appears once â€” will remain in the end.
- **Time Taken:** 10 min  

- **Solution Code:**

```java
class Solution {
    public int singleNumber(int[] nums) {
        Map<Integer,Integer> map = new HashMap<>();

        for(int num : nums) {
            if(map.get(num)!=null) {
               map.put(num,map.get(num)+1);
               continue;
            }  
            map.put(num,1);
        }

         for (Integer key : map.keySet()) {
          
                if(map.get(key)==1) {
                    return key;
                };
        }

        return 1;
    }
}

```

- **Optimized Code:**

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int singleNumber(int[] nums) {
        int result = 0;

        for (int num : nums) {
            result ^= num;
        }

        return result;
    }
}


```

- **Problem:** [Missing Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/missing-number/)
- **Difficulty:** Easy  
- **Category:** Arrays  
- **My Approach:**  
- I sorted the array, then compared each number with its expected index value.  
- If the number differed from the index, I returned that index as the missing number.  
- The optimized solution is to use the formula for the sum of the first `n` natural numbers:  
  `sum = n * (n + 1) / 2`.  
- Then subtract the actual sum of the array from this expected sum.  
- The difference will be the missing number.

- **Time Taken:** 10 min  

- **Solution Code:**

```java
class Solution {
    public int missingNumber(int[] nums) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int n = nums.length;

        for(int i=0;i<=nums.length;i++) {
            if(i==nums.length) {
                return i; 
            }
            if(nums[i] != i) {
                return i;
            };
        }

        return nums[0];
        }
}
```

- **Optimized Code:**

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int missingNumber(int[] nums) {
        int nlength = nums.length;
        int expectedSum = nlength * (nlength+1)/2;
        int currentSum = 0;

        for(int num: nums) {
            currentSum += num;
        }

        return expectedSum - currentSum;
    }
}
