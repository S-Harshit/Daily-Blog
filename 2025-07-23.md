## ðŸ“˜ Daily LeetCode Log

A simple daily log of LeetCode problems I solve or projects I build to improve problem-solving skills and stay consistent.  
The goal is to do **1 problem every day no matter what**, along with some project work.

- **Problem:** [Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/)
- **Difficulty:** Easy  
- **Category:** Arrays  
- **My Approach:**  
  - Started with the brute-force method by checking every possible pair of buy and sell days to calculate profit, and tracking the maximum.
  - This approach failed due to excessive runtime.
  - Realized the need for a more optimized approach, commonly referred to as the sliding window technique.
  - The key idea is to keep track of the minimum stock price seen so far while iterating through the array. At each step, calculate the potential profit by subtracting this minimum from the current price.
  - This way, we can determine the maximum profit in a single pass through the array.
- **Time Taken:** 1 hr

- **Problem:** [Merge Sorted Arrays](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-sorted-array/description/)
- **Difficulty:** Easy  
- **Category:** Arrays  
- **My Approach:**  
  - Initially tried a brute-force approach using two pointers and applying merge sort logic.
  - However, the problem specifically states that we must modify the first array in-place, which already has enough space (length `m + n`) to hold all elements.
  - A better approach is to start filling `nums1` from the end rather than the beginning. This allows us to insert elements directly without overwriting existing values or needing extra space.
  - I wasn't able to come up with the optimal approach on my own this time.
- **Time Taken:** 10 min  
- **Solution Code:**
