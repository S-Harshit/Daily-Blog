## ğŸ“˜ Daily LeetCode Log

A simple daily log of LeetCode problems I solve or projects I build to improve problem-solving skills and stay consistent.  
The goal is to do **1 problem every day no matter what**, along with some project work.

- **Problem:** [BinarySearch](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search/description/)
- **Difficulty:** Easy  
- **Category:** Arrays  
- **My Approach:** 
- Even though I already knew how Binary Search works, when trying to figure out the exit condition for the recursion,  
- I just wasn't able to get it rightâ€”definitely something I need to practice more.  
- Itâ€™s such a simple question, and honestly, if you canâ€™t do this one, it really comes down to a skill issue.

- **Time Taken:** 1 hr

- **Solution Code:**

```java
class Solution {
    private int binarySearch(int start, int end, int[] nums, int target) {
         if (start > end) {
            return -1; 
        }

        int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;

        if (nums[mid] == target) {
            return mid;
        } else if (nums[mid] < target) {
            return binarySearch(mid + 1, end, nums, target); 
        } else {
            return binarySearch(start, mid - 1, nums, target); 
        }
    }

    public int search(int[] nums, int target) {
       return binarySearch(0,nums.length-1,nums,target);
        
    }
}
```
