## ðŸ“˜ Daily LeetCode Log

A simple daily log of LeetCode problems I solve or projects I build to improve problem-solving skills and stay consistent.  
The goal is to do **1 problem every day no matter what**, along with some project work.

- **Problem:** [Power of Two](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-consecutive-ones/)
- **Difficulty:** Easy  
- **Category:** Recursion  
- **My Approach:**  
  - I stored the number as a float.
  - Then, using a `while` loop, I continuously divided the number by 2.
  - If the number became exactly 2, I concluded it's a power of 2.
  - If the number dropped below 2, then it's not a power of 2.
  - If the number was `0`, I reset the consecutive counter.
  - However, the question specifically asked for a recursive solution. I wasn't able to come up with a recursive approach myself â€” though to be fair, I didnâ€™t spend much time trying as it is weekend.

- **Time Taken:** 10 min  

- **Solution Code:**

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isPowerOfTwo(int n) {
        double num = n; 
        if(n==1) {
            return true;
        }
        while(num>1) {
             if(num == 2) {
                return true;
             }
            num = num/2;
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```

- **Optimized Code:**

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isPowerOfTwo(int n) {
         if (n == 1) {
            return true;
        }
        if (n <= 0 || n % 2 != 0) {
            return false;
        }
        return isPowerOfTwo(n / 2);
    
    }
}
